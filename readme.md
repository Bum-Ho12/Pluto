This project aims to create a standard framework that can be used to create applications with python and Kivy.
Ensure Python is installed in your computer.

To complete setup, please:
1. run on cmd "python pluto.py setup"
2. run on cmd "python pluto.py fetch"

To run the application, run script on cmd
"python pluto.py run"

Definition

Understood. Transforming Kivy into a more declarative framework with features like hot reload, statefulness, and a context architecture similar to Flutter is a challenging but interesting goal. Here are some considerations and potential strategies:

Widget Abstraction:

Define a higher-level widget abstraction that aligns with the declarative paradigm. This abstraction should encapsulate both the visual representation and the behavior of widgets.
Implement widgets that are independent of Kivy's existing event-driven system, making them more declarative.
State Management:

Develop a state management system that integrates with your declarative widgets.
Consider whether you want to maintain your own state management system or leverage Kivy's internal state management where applicable.
Reactivity:

Design a reactive system that allows widgets to automatically update based on changes in their state.
Leverage Kivy's properties and event system or introduce your own reactive mechanisms.
Context Architecture:

Extend the context architecture to work seamlessly with your declarative widgets.
Ensure that the context architecture supports features like dependency injection, shared state, and easy widget communication.
Hot Reload:

Develop a hot reload mechanism that can efficiently update the UI based on changes in the declarative code.
Consider how this mechanism interacts with Kivy's existing reloading mechanisms and whether adjustments are needed.
Compatibility:

Aim for compatibility with existing Kivy code where possible. This allows users to gradually adopt your declarative framework without a complete rewrite.
Documentation and Community Support:

Provide comprehensive documentation and examples to help developers understand how to use your declarative framework effectively.
Foster a community around your framework to encourage collaboration and support.
Testing:

Implement a robust testing strategy to ensure the reliability of your framework, especially considering the transformation of a complex framework like Kivy.
Remember that transforming an existing framework comes with challenges, and trade-offs may be necessary. Regularly gather feedback from developers using your framework to iterate and improve its design and functionality.
